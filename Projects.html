                </ul>
                <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
                <h5>Wheelchairs have been used for transporting patients as well as disabled for quite a long time.
                    Wheelchairs are driven by manual efforts, The disabled drive wheelchairs by their hands while
                    another person is required to push patientâ€™s wheelchair. Here we propose a simple attachable
                    extension that can be attached to a wheelchair and can transform wheelchairs into E wheelchairs that
                    require no manual efforts. The system makes use of batteries to drive the wheelchair and no
                    fuel-based engine which makes it ecofriendly.
                    The attachment uses metal rods and pipe arrangement designed to be attached to a wheelchair front
                    rod and thus clamp on the front wheelchair rods. We then use a ball bearing integrated handle
                    fabricated with efficient support in order to achieve directional movement. We now use a chain-based
                    arrangement that connects motor to the wheel arrangement in order to drive the attachment. Our
                    system uses batteries to power the motor and a switching arrangement in order to switch on and off
                    the motor and achieve desired movement.

                    <ul>
                        <li>To design and build an automated wheel chair for physically challenged persons for their
                            independent movement.</li>
                        <li>To design low budget automated wheelchair.</li>
                        <li>To design a Wheelchair that works on battery.</li>
                        <li>To reduce human effort done by physically challenged people. </li>

                <h2>CONSTRUCTION</h2>
                <h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initially a wheelchair (old or new) is connected to an automate that consist of a frame that has motor, driving wheel and handle. the chain drive is used to transmit the power from motor to the driving wheel, batteries are used to power the motor which are mounted on the wooden plank and is attached below the seat of the user. The handle is used to direct the movement of the vehicle.</li>
                        <li>Primarily the driving wheel was prepared by attaching the driven gear to wheel with the help of free wheel welded to wheel rim.</li>
                        <li>The handle frame consists of handle bar attached vertically to frame</li>
                        <li>The wheel is attached to handle with the help of shaft over which the wheel rotates the wheel is driven with the help of chain.  </li>
                        <li>The motor is mounted just above front wheel and is fixed in a plate which is again welded to the frame with help of metal plate.</li>
                        <li>The handle contains break levers and throttle handle which are further connected to controller.</li>
                        <li>The batteries are used as power source which are mounter below the seat and are connected directly to controller  </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>WORKING PROCEDURE</h2>
                <h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The motor power supply is switched on by using the key </li>
                        <li>When the throttle handle is rotated, the signal is sent to controller.</li>
                        <li>The controller supplies power to motor ,which results in rotation of pinion</li>
                        <li>The power transmitted by motor reaches the driven gear and further to wheel with help of chain.</li>
                        <li>This result in movement of vehicle or wheelchair.</li>
                    </ul>
